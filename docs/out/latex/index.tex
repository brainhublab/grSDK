"The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) solution of the least-\/squares method. The filter is very powerful in several aspects\+: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown." (quoted from \mbox{[}02\mbox{]}) ~\newline
This version of the Kalman filter is in fact a Variable-\/\+Dimension Extended Kalman Filter (V\+D\+E\+KF). It supports optimized algorithms (translated from Fortran -\/ see \mbox{[}01\mbox{]}), even in the presence of correlated process or measurement noise. ~\newline
